    </h1>
    <img src="g.jpg">
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor 
        life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but 
        also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere</p>
